I was exploring different time series techniques on a relatively simple and clean dataset where I was  given 5 years of store-item sales data, and asked to predict 3 months of sales for 50 different items at 10 different stores.
I then decided to go for deep learning using XgBoost as I thought that it would work better than ARIMA.

This was a great competition to explore different models and improve my skills in forecasting.
